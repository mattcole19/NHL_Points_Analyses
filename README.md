# NHL Points Analyses

## Overview

## Disclaimer
This was one my first ever personal coding projects, so the code is fairly messy. I was just using it to learn pandas and webscraping


## What I Learned

I used this project to gain experience with pandas and the main Python webscraping modules beautifulsoup4 and requests.  The script scrapes every NHL game from the 2017-2018 season and creates a dataframe consisting of team statistics.
