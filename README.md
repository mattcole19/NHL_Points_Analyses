# NHL Points Analyses

## Overview
This project scrapes all NHL games for the 2017-2018 season and generates a dataframe identical to the one on the standings page on NHL.com


## What I Learned
- Pandas - This was my first time using Pandas so it allowed me to touch the surface on the capabilities of manipulating data with Pyhon
- Web Scraping - BeautfiulSoup4 also taught me a little bit about HTML along the way
- GUIs - Tkinter was a great way to learn more about OOP

#### Disclaimer
This was one my first ever personal coding projects, so the code is fairly messy. I was just using it to learn pandas and webscraping
