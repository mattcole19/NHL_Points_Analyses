NHL Statistical Analyses
Note: This was one my first ever personal coding project, so the code is fairly messy. 
I used this project to gain experience with pandas and the main Python webscraping modules beautifulsoup4 and requests.  The script scrapes every NHL game from the 2017-2018 season and creates a dataframe consisting of team statistics.
